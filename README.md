# yggdrasil / An Arch Linux Distribution Framework
A set of proof-of-concept packages designed to demonstrate and test the power of the Arch Build System. The goal is to exemplify a pseudo-reproducible build of a group of operating systems forming a complete homelab infrastructure by utilizing custom packages/metapackages. In the end, an entire operating system and all of its configurations should be installed by passing `pacstrap` a single package name during a traditional Arch Linux install.
